## Advent of Code 2015

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015).

My approach to these problems was a bit unusual. I solved 17 of the 25 problem sets in Python, before deciding to use them as a way to learn (C++) CUDA. So, I re-solved about 6 of those 17 problems in CUDA, before completing the remaining 8 unsolved ones in CUDA as well.

Three folders in this project:
- cuda 
- python
- data

The `cuda` and `python` directories contain the solutions for those respective languages. `data` contains the input given by Advent of Code 2015. (Not every day has data because for days with shorter input, I generally put the data directly into the code instead of loading it from a file.)
